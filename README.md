# Quantified-Self

Analysis and machine learning models of personal time series data collected over two years.

I recorded my weight and various coarse, easy-to-record variables relating to my diet, sleep, exercise, and quality of
life over the course of two years with the aim of satisfying my personal curiosity about my habits and to see if I could
build an accurate machine learning model built only on coarse grained features, e.g. minutes of exercise, number of
sweets eaten, etc. Since tracking diet via calorie counting and calories burned exercising is involved and annoying, my
hope was to capture enough information with easier-to-record features to be able to predict weight changes with less
hassle. I cataloged this project in four Jupyter notebooks:
